# react_wordle
Brushing back up on my react since I had a similar question in a tech screen.

Gave myself a 1 hour timelimit to make Wordle in React

Things uncomplete:

* Should be prettier
* Should prevent submission if guess isn't 5 chars
* should .toLowerCase() guess against answer - case sensitivity is dumb
* Adjust how turns are stored - Keep it to just be word and let the component compute squares
* Select word from random bank of words
* "Play Again?" button - regenerates word / state
